## Technical Briefing üí°

**Introducing YOLOv13**‚Äîthe next-generation real-time detector with cutting-edge performance and efficiency. YOLOv13 family includes four variants: Nano, Small, Large, and X-Large, powered by:

* **HyperACE: Hypergraph-based Adaptive Correlation Enhancement**
  * Treats pixels in multi-scale feature maps as hypergraph vertices.
  * Adopts a learnable hyperedge construction module to adaptively exploring high-order correlations between vertices.
  * A message passing module with linear complexity is leveraged to effectively aggregate multi-scale features with the guidance of high-order correlations to achieve effective visual perception of complex scenarios.

* **FullPAD: Full-Pipeline Aggregation-and-Distribution Paradigm**
  * Uses the HyperACE to aggregate multi-scale features of the backbone and extract high-order correlations in the hypergraph space.
  * FullPAD paradigm further leverages three separate tunnels to forward these correlation-enhanced features to the connection between the backbone and neck, the internal layers of the neck, and the connection between the neck and head, respectively. In this way, YOLOv13 achieves fine‚Äëgrained information flow and representational synergy across the entire pipeline.
  * FullPAD significantly improves gradient propagation and enhances the detection performance.

* **Model Lightweighting via DS-based Blocks**
  * Replaces large-kernel convolutions with blocks building based on depthwise separable convolutions (DSConv, DS-Bottleneck, DS-C3k, DS-C3k2), preserving receptive field while greatly reducing parameters and computation.
  * Achieves faster inference speed without sacrificing accuracy.

> YOLOv13 seamlessly combines hypergraph computation with end-to-end information collaboration to deliver a more accurate, robust, and efficient real-time detection solution.

**Representative visualization examples of adaptive hyperedges. The hyperedges in the first and second columns mainly focus on the high-order interactions among objects in the foreground. The third column mainly focuses on the high-order interactions between the background and part of the foreground. The visualization of these hyperedges can intuitively reflect the high-order visual associations modeled by the YOLOv13.**
